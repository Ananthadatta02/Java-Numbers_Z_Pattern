# Java-Numbers_Z_Pattern
This Java program prints a 'Z' shaped number pattern based on user input. The top and bottom rows display numbers from 1 to n, while the diagonal from top-right to bottom-left shows decreasing numbers. It uses nested loops and conditionals to format the output pattern accordingly.
